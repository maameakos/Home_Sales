# Home_Sales

In this challenge, I used my knowledge of SparkSQL to determine key metrics about home sales data. Then, I used Spark to create temporary views, partition the data, cache and uncached a temporary table, and verify that the table had been uncached.

Questions to answer using SparkSQL:

What is the average price for a four-bedroom house sold for each year? Round off your answer to two decimal places.

The average price of a home with three bedrooms and three bathrooms for each year it was built. Round off your answer to two decimal places.

What is the average price of a home built each year with three bedrooms, three bathrooms, two floors, and greater than or equal to 2,000 square feet? Round off your answer to two decimal places.

Is the average price of a home per "view" rating having an average home price greater than or equal to $350,000? Determine the run time for this query and round off your answer to two decimal places.
